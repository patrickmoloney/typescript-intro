# Typescript & SASS Boilerplate

## TODO:

- Ensure all packages require are included
- Flesh out css (which will be converted to SASS during workshop)
- Add folder structure to `src` folder
- Flesh out html to cater for full project
- update webpack to dynamically add script/css to `index.html` and copy over to `dist` folder

> ## Note this is a WIP
